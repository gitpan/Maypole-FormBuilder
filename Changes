0.3     Fri 22 July 2005, 23:00    
        - templates 
            - split the autohandler into header, navbar, title and footer templates
            - added greying-out for ReadOnly and Disabled input classes
            - added edit_with_related template - override this with an empty edit_with_related to 
                remove the edit_with_related form in the edit template
            - edit template 
                - related fields are no longer rendered in the default edit form. 
                    Instead, they are displayed in a table following the form, 
                    with the new addto template
            - addto - a new template, used in the edit template, to add a has_many item 
                
                
        - Maypole::FormBuilder::Model
            - removed related() from the default fields list in edit mode in setup_form_mode
                - see edit template above
            - added addto mode to setup_form_mode, with a corresponding addto Exported method
            - addto doesn't work with many_many relationships yet

0.28    Fri  22 July 2005, 00:50
        - Maypole::FormBuilder::Model
            - added list_fields() method, which defaults to related(). Used in setup_form_mode() in the 
                editlist mode to supply the fields list (list_columns + list_fields), so that both the 
                form built for the client, and the form built by the server to handle a submission, use 
                the same default field list
            - note: MP::QuickTable 0.31 tabulate() defaults to display_columns + related, but the list 
                template sets fields to list_columns + list_fields, so that editlistview and listview 
                show the same fields. 
            - added some documentation to explain how server and client forms are 
                co-ordinated by setup_form_mode.
                
        - templates
            - list - explicitly set the fields argument to tabulate() in .listview (list_columns + list_fields)
        
0.27    Thur 21 July 2005, 19:45
        - templates
            - list - build a dummy form if no forms are available in editlistview
            - moved Mason templates to templates-mason/
            - added TT templates (in templates-tt/) from Ron McClain

0.26   Wed 20 July 2005, 12:00
        - templates
            - pager: re-organised layout of code, and added code from Ron McClain to correctly 
                page search results
            - list: moved the pager to above the table of results, and now show page number
                even for a single page of results
        
        - Maypole::FormBuilder::Model        
            - uncommented code in list() to return sorted results, now that the framework is in 
                place to provide the required parameters        

0.25   Wed 20 July 2005, 00:45
        - Maypole::Plugin::FormBuilder
            - removed some dead code incl. as_form_with_related
        
        - Maypole::FormBuilder::Model
            - load Class::DBI::Plugin::Type, rather than expecting the caller to do so
            
        - templates
            - removed view_related - MP::P::QuickTable is smart enough to figure out 
                has_many items in the view template
            - adjusted column naming in list template to include has_many fields - 
                see MP::P::QuickTable for other changes to make listview and editlistview 
                show the same data - see http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=13779
            - added some notes in source of pager template, sent by Ron McClain, to get the 
                pager to work for search results. There's still a couple of things broken at the 
                moment though - see also http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=13781    
                
        - added Maypole::Plugin::QuickTable as a prereq

        - more POD fixes

0.211  Fri  24 June 2005, 14:30
        - very minor POD fixes

0.21   Tues 14 Jun 2005, 11:50
        - fixed searching by not setting the form mode to do_search in MP::Plugin::FB::do_search()
            (I don't get why that would break it though)
        - fixed bugs in list template when a search returns no objects (use 
            $request->model_class instead of $object->[0]) 
        - removed template var 'search' from list template - check $request->action eq 
            'do_search' instead
        - refactored search template to take advantage of new search_opt_cmp and search_opt_order_by 
            options in CDBI::FB::search_form()
        - removed has_a fields from required lists in MP::Plugin::FB synopsis - CDBI::FB now adds them 
            automatically        

0.2    Sun  12 Jun 2005, 17:20
        - fixed the editlist mode, so all the buttons now work (unsetting sticky 
            forms was the key - otherwise, all the forms adopted the values in 
            the submitted request)
        
        - added sessions to the demo app, to keep track of the list view mode
            - various modifications to methods in MP::FB::Model
            - added switchlistmode() exported method
            
        - MP::Plugin::FB:
            - removed HTML rendering mode from MP::Plugin::FB::as_forms()
            - added MP::Plugin::FB::render_form_as_row()
            - added MP::Plugin::FB::listviewmode() to return the list view mode from the 
                session (or 'list' if no session is available)
        
        - templates:
            - removed the editlist template - it's all in the list template now
            - removed hacks from pager and addnew templates to support different list view modes

0.12   Sat  11 Jun 2005, 21:45
        - Fixed a bug in Maypole::Plugin::FormBuilder::setup(). The vars() method 
            in the view class was removing classmetadata from _all_ apps in the 
            current interpreter that used the same view as the FB app. Bad for 
            mod_perl.

0.11   Fri  10 Jun 2005, 11:55
        - morning after the night before POD fixes
        - all modules load MP::FB and use its VERSION 
        - moved do_delete() from MP::FB::Model::Base to MP::FB::Model

0.1    Thur  9 Jun 2005, 22:45
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
