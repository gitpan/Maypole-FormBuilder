Revision history for Maypole-FormBuilder

0.26   Wed 20 July 2005, 12:00
        - templates
            - pager: re-organised layout of code, and added code from Ron McClain to correctly 
                page search results
            - list: moved the pager to above the table of results, and now show page number
                even for a single page of results
        
        - Maypole::FormBuilder::Model        
            - uncommented code in list() to return sorted results, now that the framework is in 
                place to provide the required parameters        

0.25   Wed 20 July 2005, 00:45
        - Maypole::Plugin::FormBuilder
            - removed some dead code incl. as_form_with_related
        
        - Maypole::FormBuilder::Model
            - load Class::DBI::Plugin::Type, rather than expecting the caller to do so
            
        - templates
            - removed view_related - MP::P::QuickTable is smart enough to figure out 
                has_many items in the view template
            - adjusted column naming in list template to include has_many fields - 
                see MP::P::QuickTable for other changes to make listview and editlistview 
                show the same data - see http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=13779
            - added some notes in source of pager template, sent by Ron McClain, to get the 
                pager to work for search results. There's still a couple of things broken at the 
                moment though - see also http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=13781    
                
        - added Maypole::Plugin::QuickTable as a prereq

        - more POD fixes

0.211  Fri  24 June 2005, 14:30
        - very minor POD fixes

0.21   Tues 14 Jun 2005, 11:50
        - fixed searching by not setting the form mode to do_search in MP::Plugin::FB::do_search()
            (I don't get why that would break it though)
        - fixed bugs in list template when a search returns no objects (use 
            $request->model_class instead of $object->[0]) 
        - removed template var 'search' from list template - check $request->action eq 
            'do_search' instead
        - refactored search template to take advantage of new search_opt_cmp and search_opt_order_by 
            options in CDBI::FB::search_form()
        - removed has_a fields from required lists in MP::Plugin::FB synopsis - CDBI::FB now adds them 
            automatically        

0.2    Sun  12 Jun 2005, 17:20
        - fixed the editlist mode, so all the buttons now work (unsetting sticky 
            forms was the key - otherwise, all the forms adopted the values in 
            the submitted request)
        
        - added sessions to the demo app, to keep track of the list view mode
            - various modifications to methods in MP::FB::Model
            - added switchlistmode() exported method
            
        - MP::Plugin::FB:
            - removed HTML rendering mode from MP::Plugin::FB::as_forms()
            - added MP::Plugin::FB::render_form_as_row()
            - added MP::Plugin::FB::listviewmode() to return the list view mode from the 
                session (or 'list' if no session is available)
        
        - templates:
            - removed the editlist template - it's all in the list template now
            - removed hacks from pager and addnew templates to support different list view modes

0.12   Sat  11 Jun 2005, 21:45
        - Fixed a bug in Maypole::Plugin::FormBuilder::setup(). The vars() method 
            in the view class was removing classmetadata from _all_ apps in the 
            current interpreter that used the same view as the FB app. Bad for 
            mod_perl.

0.11   Fri  10 Jun 2005, 11:55
        - morning after the night before POD fixes
        - all modules load MP::FB and use its VERSION 
        - moved do_delete() from MP::FB::Model::Base to MP::FB::Model

0.1    Thur  9 Jun 2005, 22:45
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
