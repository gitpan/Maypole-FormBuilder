Revision history for Maypole-FormBuilder

0.12   Sat  11 Jun 2005, 21:45
        - Fixed a bug in Maypole::Plugin::FormBuilder::setup(). The vars() method 
            in the view class was removing classmetadata from _all_ apps in the 
            current interpreter that used the same view as the FB app. Bad for 
            mod_perl.
