Revision history for Maypole-FormBuilder

0.43    Fri  23 Sept, 2005 22:40

        Class::DBI::FormBuilder 0.46 - has-many and many-many support has improved

        - Maypole::FormBuilder::Model
            - display_columns now includes has_many fields by default
            - all the *_fields() methods are empty by default, except edit_fields()
            
        - Maypole::Plugin::FormBuilder
            - _form_args() sets 'required' to the stringify_column(), unless it is 
                already configured. This stops the default from being 'require all 
                columns', which was a pain
                
        - Mason templates
            - added caching versions of the main editing templates. In an app with a large
                number of related tables, this speeds up the generation of the edit page 
                by at least 4X. These templates are not used by default - see the edit_with_cache 
                template for details.
            

0.42    Mon  19 Sept, 2005 11:40
        - updated the TT templates (supplied by Ron McClain)

0.413   Sun  18 Sept, 2005 20:45
        - fix a failure in pod test script 

0.412   Tues 23 August, 2005 17:15
        - added custom fields to process_extras in ADDTO and EDIT_ALL_HAS_A 
            entries in the setup_from_mode dispatch table, so that 
            they actually get included in the forms

0.411   Tues 23 August, 2005 12:00
        - fixed search_form to set $r as the param object - reported by Dave Howorth
        - support TT's way of passing args that look like a hash, as a hashref - patch 
            from Dave Howorth

0.41    Fri 19 August, 2005 15:50
        - do_pager (and Mp::FB) now works even without sessions (Dave Howorth)
        - slight tweak to setup_form_mode() to ignore process_fields setting in the 
            button modes

0.4     Sat 13 August, 2005
        - new dependencies: Maypole::Plugin::LinkTools, Maypole::Plugin::Session,
            URI and URI::QueryParam, List::Util

        - Maypole::FormBuilder::Model
            - new methods:
                - several new *_columns() and *_fields() methods
                - hasa_columns() returns a list of columns that are in has_a relationships
                - field_names() - provides names (i.e. labels) for has_many accessors, just 
                    like Maypole::Model::Base::column_names() does for columns
                - edit_all_has_a() - Exported method
                
            - display_columns() returns the columns in the order they are specified in 
                the database
            
            - various additions and modifications to setup_form_mode(), to support 
                new templates, and to move code out of the templates and into the model,
                and to use the new *_columns and *_fields methods
                
            - do_pager() records the current page in the session
            - copied new version of order() from Maypole::Model::CDBI in version 2.10
            
        - Maypole::Plugin::FormBuilder
            - added table_labels slot to config object, and populate it in setup()
            - ensure each class has its own private form_builder_defaults hashref
                (in setup())
            - factored out _get_form_args()
            - removed no_textareas option from as_forms - it's hard-wired in render_form_as_row() 
                now
            - forms now pass a unique ID in their action, to be used to prevent multiple
                submissions (_add_unique_id)
            - _form_args now allows MP::FB::Model::setup_form_mode() to change the CDBI/Maypole 
                object the form is built from 
            
        - templates
            - new templates
                - custom_css         - loads a class-specific css file, if one exists
                - /beer/css/beer.css - example class-specific css file
                - addmany
                - edit_all_has_a
                - view_all_has_a
            
            - modifications to edit, header, addto, maypole.css, addnew, addmany, 
                generally moving perl code out of the template and into setup_form_mode()
            - moved maypole.css back into the css subdirectory
            - if /css/maypole_local.css exists, it will be loaded
            - if /css/$table.css exists for the current model_class, it will be loaded 
                e.g. /beer/css/beer.css in the factory templates

0.32    Tues 9 Aug  2005, 1:20
        - pass the Maypole request object to CGI::FB, instead of the CGI or Apache request object,
            since Maypole has a suitable params() method - suggested by Dave Howarth
            
        - de-activated default PrettyPrint mode - you can get it now using CDBI::FB's post-processor 
            architecture 
            
        - Maypole::FormBuilder::Model
            - setup_form_mode() accepts a new mode_args argument, which is a hashref. The addto and
                addmany templates use this 
            - refactored setup_form_mode() to use a dispatch table of coderefs
            
        - templates
            - edit  - simplified generation and layout of has_many forms
            - addto - simplified, moved code into setup_form_mode()
            - addmany - supports adding multiple items in a has_many relationship
            - maypole.css - slight tweaks
            - list - slight tweaks

0.312   Wed  3 Aug  2005, 23:50
        - swap the order of looking for ar or cgi in _form_args() (reported by Dave Howorth)
        - activated CDBI::FB's new pretty-print mode, for the next few releases. Then I'll switch 
            it off again. This makes HTML::TreeBuilder a new dependency. I'll try and figure out how 
            to make this optional from Maypole.

0.311   Tues  2 Aug  2005, 23:48
        - included the new templates

0.31    Tues  2 Aug  2005, 23:40
        - removed dependency on CDBI::Plugin::Type - CDBI::FB doesn't need it any more
        
        - Maypole::FormBuilder::Model
            - added search_columns(), search_fields(), edit_columns() and edit_fields() methods
            
        - templates
            - search - moved all configuration of the search form into setup_form_mode(),
                        using the new SET_$foo() processor in CDBI::FB 0.41
            - edit - uses edit_fields() instead of related()

0.302   Sun 31 July 2005, 18:55
        - optionally pass $mode as a positional arg to as_form()

0.301   Sun 31 July 2005, 17:30
        new TT view template from Ron McLain

0.3     Fri 22 July 2005, 23:00    
        - templates 
            - split the autohandler into header, navbar, title and footer templates
            - added greying-out for ReadOnly and Disabled input classes
            - added edit_with_related template - override this with an empty edit_with_related to 
                remove the edit_with_related form in the edit template
            - edit template 
                - related fields are no longer rendered in the default edit form. 
                    Instead, they are displayed in a table following the form, 
                    with the new addto template
            - addto - a new template, used in the edit template, to add a has_many item 
                
                
        - Maypole::FormBuilder::Model
            - removed related() from the default fields list in edit mode in setup_form_mode
                - see edit template above
            - added addto mode to setup_form_mode, with a corresponding addto Exported method
            - addto doesn't work with many_many relationships yet

0.28    Fri  22 July 2005, 00:50
        - Maypole::FormBuilder::Model
            - added list_fields() method, which defaults to related(). Used in setup_form_mode() in the 
                editlist mode to supply the fields list (list_columns + list_fields), so that both the 
                form built for the client, and the form built by the server to handle a submission, use 
                the same default field list
            - note: MP::QuickTable 0.31 tabulate() defaults to display_columns + related, but the list 
                template sets fields to list_columns + list_fields, so that editlistview and listview 
                show the same fields. 
            - added some documentation to explain how server and client forms are 
                co-ordinated by setup_form_mode.
                
        - templates
            - list - explicitly set the fields argument to tabulate() in .listview (list_columns + list_fields)
        
0.27    Thur 21 July 2005, 19:45
        - templates
            - list - build a dummy form if no forms are available in editlistview
            - moved Mason templates to templates-mason/
            - added TT templates (in templates-tt/) from Ron McClain

0.26   Wed 20 July 2005, 12:00
        - templates
            - pager: re-organised layout of code, and added code from Ron McClain to correctly 
                page search results
            - list: moved the pager to above the table of results, and now show page number
                even for a single page of results
        
        - Maypole::FormBuilder::Model        
            - uncommented code in list() to return sorted results, now that the framework is in 
                place to provide the required parameters        

0.25   Wed 20 July 2005, 00:45
        - Maypole::Plugin::FormBuilder
            - removed some dead code incl. as_form_with_related
        
        - Maypole::FormBuilder::Model
            - load Class::DBI::Plugin::Type, rather than expecting the caller to do so
            
        - templates
            - removed view_related - MP::P::QuickTable is smart enough to figure out 
                has_many items in the view template
            - adjusted column naming in list template to include has_many fields - 
                see MP::P::QuickTable for other changes to make listview and editlistview 
                show the same data - see http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=13779
            - added some notes in source of pager template, sent by Ron McClain, to get the 
                pager to work for search results. There's still a couple of things broken at the 
                moment though - see also http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=13781    
                
        - added Maypole::Plugin::QuickTable as a prereq

0.2433 Mon 18 July 2005, 21:00
        - fixed maypole.css link in autohandler template 

0.2432 Mon 18 July 2005, 12:55
        - removed empty beer templates directory
        - moved maypole.css to factory/ subdir, and removed css/ subdir
        - upgraded CDBI::FB requirement to 0.3501 in Build.PL

0.2431 Sun 17 July 2005, 12:10
        - require CDBI::FB 0.3452 (not 0.35, which doesn't exist) in Build.PL

0.243  Sat 16 July 2005, 22:45
        - load use Class::DBI::Plugin::Type in MP::FB::Model

0.242  Mon 11  Jul 2005, 21:55
        - fixed bug in MP::FB::Model::setup_database() - 

0.241  Mon  11 Jul 2005, 21:45
        - a couple of minor updates to docs

0.24   Fri   1 Jul 2005, 16:30
        - got rid of MP::FB::Model::Base

0.23   Thur 30 Jun 2005, 11:00
        - added Maypole::FormBuilder::Model::Plain

0.22   Tues 28 Jun 2005, 14:00
        - added as_form_with_related() method to MP::P::FB to support the same method 
            in CDBI::FB

0.212  Tues 28 Jun 2005, 12:30
        - more POD fixes

0.211  Fri  24 June 2005, 14:30
        - very minor POD fixes

0.21   Tues 14 Jun 2005, 11:50
        - fixed searching by not setting the form mode to do_search in MP::Plugin::FB::do_search()
            (I don't get why that would break it though)
        - fixed bugs in list template when a search returns no objects (use 
            $request->model_class instead of $object->[0]) 
        - removed template var 'search' from list template - check $request->action eq 
            'do_search' instead
        - refactored search template to take advantage of new search_opt_cmp and search_opt_order_by 
            options in CDBI::FB::search_form()
        - removed has_a fields from required lists in MP::Plugin::FB synopsis - CDBI::FB now adds them 
            automatically        

0.2    Sun  12 Jun 2005, 17:20
        - fixed the editlist mode, so all the buttons now work (unsetting sticky 
            forms was the key - otherwise, all the forms adopted the values in 
            the submitted request)
        
        - added sessions to the demo app, to keep track of the list view mode
            - various modifications to methods in MP::FB::Model
            - added switchlistmode() exported method
            
        - MP::Plugin::FB:
            - removed HTML rendering mode from MP::Plugin::FB::as_forms()
            - added MP::Plugin::FB::render_form_as_row()
            - added MP::Plugin::FB::listviewmode() to return the list view mode from the 
                session (or 'list' if no session is available)
        
        - templates:
            - removed the editlist template - it's all in the list template now
            - removed hacks from pager and addnew templates to support different list view modes

0.12   Sat  11 Jun 2005, 21:45
        - Fixed a bug in Maypole::Plugin::FormBuilder::setup(). The vars() method 
            in the view class was removing classmetadata from _all_ apps in the 
            current interpreter that used the same view as the FB app. Bad for 
            mod_perl.

0.11   Fri  10 Jun 2005, 11:55
        - morning after the night before POD fixes
        - all modules load MP::FB and use its VERSION 
        - moved do_delete() from MP::FB::Model::Base to MP::FB::Model

0.1    Thur  9 Jun 2005, 22:45
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
